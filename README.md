# Data-analysis-star-projects-portfolio
This are my star projects build from scratch for my portfolio as data analyst i have used Python for programming.

1) Iris Data set analysis -Machine learning project
 In this project i have worked on iris data set with 150 samples of data ,and by using 6 different algorithms i have tried to find best fit for by prediction model ,later on i have used my built model on test data set to see the correctness of predictionand hence with charactteristics like sepal-length,petal-width etc 4 chracteristics we can predict the class of the flower.
 
2) Naive Bayes data-analysis
In this project i have applied the naives bayes algorithm to weather dataset which predicts whether it should go for playing or not ,diabetes prediction dataset and breast cancer detection dataset.
